== FAQ

*Q.* I encountered a *CREATE_FAILED* error when I launched the Quick Start.

*A.* If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, we recommend that you relaunch the template with *Rollback on failure* set to *Disabled*. (This setting is under *Advanced* on the *Options* page of the AWS CloudFormation console.) With this setting, the stack’s state is retained and the instance remains running so you can troubleshoot the issue.

WARNING: When you set *Rollback on failure* to *Disabled*, you continue to incur AWS charges for this stack. Ensure that you delete the stack after troubleshooting.

For additional information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html[Troubleshooting AWS CloudFormation^] on the AWS website.

== Troubleshooting

If commits to your repository do not show up in Amazon S3, do the following:

* Check the security parameters and endpoint in your Git webhook configuration. See link:#configuring_git_services[Configuring Git services] earlier in this guide and consult your Git service documentation for help configuring webhooks.
* Check the Lambda logs for errors. These are stored in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. For help accessing them, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/monitoring-cloudwatchlogs.html[Accessing Amazon CloudWatch logs for AWS Lambda].
* Check the AWS CodeBuild project logs for errors. To access them, do the following:
. Open the AWS CodeBuild console. 
. On the *Build history* page, click the *Build run* link for the project.
. On the *Build status* page, see the *Build logs* tab.
