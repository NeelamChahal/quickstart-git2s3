== FAQ

*Q.* I encountered a *CREATE_FAILED* error when I launched the Quick Start.

*A.* If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, we recommend that you relaunch the template with *Rollback on failure* set to *Disabled*. (This setting is under *Advanced* in the AWS CloudFormation console, *Options* page.) With this setting, the stack’s state is retained and the instance is left running, so you can troubleshoot the issue.)

WARNING: When you set *Rollback on failure* to *Disabled*, you continue to incur AWS charges for this stack. Please make sure to delete the stack when you finish troubleshooting.

For additional information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html[Troubleshooting AWS CloudFormation^] on the AWS website.

== Troubleshooting

If your commits are not being pushed through to Amazon S3, check the following:

* In your Git service’s webhooks configuration, check that your configured security parameters and the endpoint are correct. Consult the Git service documentation for detailed guidance on configuration.
* Check the Lambda logs for errors. These are stored in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. To access the logs, open the endpoint’s Lambda function in the AWS console, navigate to the *Monitoring* tab, and then choose *View logs in CloudWatch*. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-troubleshooting.html[Troubleshooting issues in AWS Lambda^] on the AWS website.

* Check the AWS CodeBuild project logs for errors. These are stored in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. To access the logs, open the endpoint’s CodeBuild Build Project in the AWS console, select a *Build run* and click on the hyperlink and navigate to the *Build logs* tab to see the build execution logs. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/troubleshooting.html[Troubleshooting AWS CodeBuild^] on the AWS website.
