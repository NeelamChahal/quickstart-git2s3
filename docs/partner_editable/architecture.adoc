*Figure 2: Webhook endpoint architecture on AWS*


The Quick Start deployment sets up a serverless AWS Cloud environment that includes the following components:

* An Amazon API Gateway endpoint to accept webhook requests from Git.
* An AWS Lambda function to process Git webhook requests received by the API Gateway and initiate builds on AWS CodeBuild.
* CodeBuild to connect and clone the Git repository, then compress and upload its contents to an Amazon S3 bucket.

IMPORTANT: The CodeBuild project that is deployed by this Quick Start must be able to connect to your Git repository, either over SSH or through the Git service endpoint. You can use a SaaS-based Git service to which AWS CodeBuild can connect over the internet.

* AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to encrypt the SSH private keys that AWS CodeBuild uses to connect to the Git repository over SSH.
* Two Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) buckets, one to store the compressed contents of the Git repository, and another to store encrypted SSH keys. 

NOTE: The first S3 bucket has versioning enabled, and all previous versions are retained indefinitely. To modify the retention period, see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/create-lifecycle.html[How do I create a lifecycle rule for an S3 bucket?].

* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles required by Lambda and API Gateway. The inline permissions attached to these roles are scoped using the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege[least privilege] model.

* Two Lambda-backed AWS CloudFormation custom resources. One resource generates an SSH key pair, encrypts it using AWS KMS, and stores it in an S3 bucket. The second resource deletes the contents of the two S3 buckets when the AWS CloudFormation stack is deleted.

WARNING: If you need backups, copy the contents of the S3 buckets before deleting the AWS CloudFormation stack.
