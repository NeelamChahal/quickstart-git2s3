Git webhooks enable event-driven integration between Git services and external applications. This Quick Start deploys endpoints to help you configure a webhook from a Git repository to AWS services in your AWS account. The code this Quick Start deploys fetches, zips, and stores Git repository contents to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) automatically when commits are pushed to the repository.

This guide describes the components that are deployed by the Quick Start, and contains links to launch the AWS CloudFormation template that automates the deployment. The guide is for IT infrastructure architects, administrators, and DevOps professionals who are planning to implement AWS services that use Amazon S3 as a source. Examples of such services include AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CodeDeploy.
