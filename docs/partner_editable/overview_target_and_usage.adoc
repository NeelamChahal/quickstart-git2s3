Git webhooks enable event-driven integration between Git services and external applications. This Quick Start implements endpoints and code you can use to link a Git repository to AWS services in your AWS account. Code to retrieve, zip, and store your repository code to an Amazon S3 bucket runs automatically when commits are pushed to the linked Git repository.

This guide explains the architecture that is deployed by the Quick Start, and links to view and launch the AWS CloudFormation template that automates the deployment. The guide is for IT infrastructure architects, administrators, and DevOps professionals who are planning to implement AWS services that use Amazon S3 as a source. Examples of such services include AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CodeDeploy.
