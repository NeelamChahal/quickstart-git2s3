After deploying this Quick Start and configuring a webhook in your Git repository, when code is pushed to the repository, the Git service sends an HTTPS POST request to the link:#_webhook_endpoints[endpoint]. The POST request contains JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data about the push operation, including the repository details, that the AWS CodeBuild project uses to fetch the latest version of your repository.

When a POST request is received, an AWS Lambda function and AWS CodeBuild project work together to retrieve, zip, and upload the Git repository to Amazon S3.

NOTE: The AWS CodeBuild project deployed by this Quick Start must be able to communicate with your Git repository using a Git service. For example, you can use a SaaS-based Git service that AWS CodeBuild can reach through the internet.
