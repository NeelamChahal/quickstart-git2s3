After deploying this Quick Start and configuring a webhook in your Git service, when a Git user pushes changes to your repository, the Git service sends an HTTPS POST request to the HTTPS endpoint. The endpoint is a URL the Quick Start creates that you use to link:#configuring_git_services[configure a Git webhook]. The HTTPS POST request contains JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data about the push that invoked the webhook action. After the request is accepted by Amazon API Gateway, it is passed to an AWS Lambda function that triggers an AWS CodeBuild project. The CodeBuild project retrieves the latest version of your repository, zips it, and uploads it to an Amazon S3 bucket. 

For more information about the components that this Quick Start deploys, see the link:#architecture[Architecture] section later in this guide.
